**What is docker?**
Docker is an open-source platform that enables developers to build, run, and manage containerized applications

**Why docker?**
Docker is widely used due to its ability to package, ship, and run applications in a consistent, isolated environment, making it easier to deploy, manage, and scale applications. T

**What is container?**
Containers are an isolated environment on the host machine(Windows/Linux/Mac) to run any code like NodeJs API or React app.

### Docker workflow contains the following

- Docker client
  This is the GUI App or CLI we install on our laptop to intract and manage docker containers.

- Docker Host (DOCKER DEAMON)
  This is the background process manages containers in the host system. It takes the commands from Docker client to manage, build, deploy and handle other tasks.

- Docker Registery (DOCKER HUB)
  This is similar to GitHub for Git. It centralized repository of docker images. Docker images are stored in Docker Hub, an image is pulled from here to Docker Host when needed..
